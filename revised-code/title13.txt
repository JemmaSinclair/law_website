# TITLE 13. SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS

## (13)00. Exception

### 0.01 Exceptions to Sentencing Enhancements:

(a) Modification of Penal Code Entries: Sentencing Enhancements within Title 13 may modify penal code entries by default. However, exceptions within penal code entries or explicit exceptions take precedence over Sentencing Enhancement policies.

(b) Example: In cases where (1)06. Murder cannot be charged for an attempt as an entire charge, (1)04. Attempted Murder exists for that purpose, and the exception in (1)04 takes precedence.

### 0.02 Stackable Penalties:

(a) General Principle: Penalties are stackable for each occurrence of an offense. Separate police incidents, occurrences at different times, offenses against different people, or charges for each prohibited object possessed may lead to stackable charges.

(b) Assault Example: Charges for assault can be stacked for each occurrence, person assaulted, or prohibited object possessed, as long as there is no explicit exception.

### 0.03 Calculation of Additional Punishment Time:

(a) Stacked Charges: Each stacked charge equals additional punishment time for that specific charge.

(b) Example: A person committing two counts of assault will be charged twice the amount of time, provided it doesn't violate maximum imprisonment policies.

### 0.04 Maximum Imprisonment Policies:

(a) Limitations: Stacked charges should not violate maximum imprisonment policies set forth in relevant penal code entries or exceptions.

(b) Compliance: Additional punishment time for stacked charges shall not exceed the maximum imprisonment specified in the relevant penal code entry or exception.
